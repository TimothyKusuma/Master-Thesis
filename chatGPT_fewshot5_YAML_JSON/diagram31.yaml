- aA 95% chance detecting medium effect (0.30) for one-tailed testing at the 0.05
  significance level.
- bA 57% chance of detecting medium effect (0.30) for one-tailed testing at the 0.05
  significance level. The low chance of 57% suggests that power may be the reason
  for the nonsignificant result.
