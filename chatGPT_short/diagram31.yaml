  - 'a A 95% chance detecting medium effect (0.30) for one-tailed testing at the 0.05 significance level.'
  - 'b A 57% chance of detecting medium effect (0.30) for one-tailed testing at the 0.05 significance level. The low chance of 57% suggests that power may be the reason for the nonsignificant result.'
